 <p>Welcome to my personal website. I'm a first-year Master's
  student at Carnegie Mellon University, majoring in ECE.</p>
 <p>This semester, I am working on a project at the Control and Learning Lab under the
  guidance of Professor Yorie Nakahira. My research focuses on the integration of control
  theory and deep learning, with a particular interest in its application on robots,
  autonomous vehicles and other autonomous systems. I also had the opportunity to collaborate
  with Professor Quiguo Zhu at Zhejiang University before coming to CMU.</p>
