  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>I'm a first-year Master's student at Carnegie Mellon University, majoring in ECE.</p>
  <p>This semester, I am working on a project at the Control and Learning Lab under the
  guidance of Professor Yorie Nakahira. My research focuses on the integration of control
  theory and deep learning, with a particular interest in its application on robots,
  autonomous vehicles and other autonomous systems. I also had the opportunity to collaborate
  with Professor Qiuguo Zhu at Zhejiang University before coming to CMU.</p>

  </ul>

  <h2>Projects</h2>
  <h3>Project 1: Blind Source Separation using Machine Learning Approaches</h3>
  <p>Description: Applied Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) and Fast Independent
    Component Analysis (FastICA) algorithms to separate mixed signals from the high-density
    electromyography (HDEMG) data.</p>
  <p>Identified the number of motor unit (MU) sources from the original data by removing
    duplicate MUs in the postprocessing phase, and calculated the MU action potentials on each dataset.</p>
